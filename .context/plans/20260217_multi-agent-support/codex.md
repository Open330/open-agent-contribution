Created and saved the technical specification at:

`docs/multi-agent-support-technical-spec.md`

It includes:
1. File-by-file implementation changes across `core`, `execution`, `budget`, and `cli`.
2. Exact proposed TypeScript function signatures for routing, provider parsing, and fallback.
3. Claude/OpenCode subprocess contracts, error-handling patterns, CLI UX changes, and a full test plan.
